#' d from t for Repeated Measures with SD Difference Scores Denominator
#'
#' This function displays d for repeated measures data
#' and the non-central confidence interval using the
#' standard deviation of the differences as the denominator
#' estimating from the t-statistic.
#'
#'  To calculate d, the t-statistic is divided by the square root of the sample size.

#' #The following example is derived from the "dept_data" dataset included
#' in the MOTE library.
#'
#' #In a study to test the effects of science fiction movies on peopleâ€™s belief
#' in the supernatural, seven people completed a measure of belief in
#' the supernatural before and after watching a popular science
#' fiction movie. Higher scores indicated higher levels of belief.
#'
#'     scifi = t.test(dept_data$before, dept_data$after, paired = TRUE)
#'
#' #The t-test value was 1.4292. You can type in the numbers directly,
#' or refer to the dataset, as shown below.
#'
#'     d.dep.t.diff.t(1.429179, n = 7, a = .05)
#'
#'     d.dep.t.diff.t(1.429179, 7, .05)
#'
#'     d.dep.t.diff.t(scifi$statistic, length(dept_data$before), .05)
#'
#' #The mean measure of belief on the pretest (dept_data$before)
#' was 5.57, with a standard deviation of 1.99. The posttest
#' (dept_data$after) scores appeared lower (M = 4.43, SD = 2.88) but did not reach
#' significance, (t(7) = 1.429, p = .20, d = .54), likely due to the small sample size.
#' The effect size was moderate (d = 0.54) suggesting the movie may
#' have influenced belief in the supernatural.
