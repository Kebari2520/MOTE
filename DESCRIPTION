Description: Measure of the Effect ('MOTE') is an effect size calculator. In research, 
    an over-reliance on p-values conceals the fact that a study is under-powered. A test 
    may be statistically significant, yet practically inconsequential. Although the 
    Task Force on Statistical Inference (established by the American Psychological 
    Association, APA) has long advocated for the inclusion of effect sizes, the vast 
    majority of peer-reviewed, published academic studies stop short of reporting 
    effect sizes and confidence intervals. To simplify the use and interpretation of 
    effect sizes and confidence intervals, we designed 'MOTE' to calculate a wide variety of effect 
    sizes in the mean differences family (all versions of d) and the variance overlap 
    family (eta, omega, epsilon, r). The package also provides non-central confidence 
    intervals for each effect size, as well as the relevant test statistics when 
    possible. Last, output for reporting in APA Style with 'LaTeX' is included.
