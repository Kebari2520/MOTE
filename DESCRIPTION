Description: MOTE is an effect size calculator. In research, an overreliance on p-values 
conceals the fact that a study is underpowered. A test may be statistically significant, 
yet practically inconsequential. Although the APA Task Force on Statistical Inference has 
long advocated for the inclusion of effect sizes, the vast majority of peer-reviewed, 
published academic studies stop short of reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals.
To simplify the use and interpretation of effect sizes and confidence intervals, we designed 
MOTE to calculate a wide variety of effect sizes in the mean differences family (all versions 
of d) and the variance overlap family (eta, omege, epsilon, r). The package also provides 
non-central confidence intervals for each effect size, as well as the relevant test statistics 
when possible. Last, output for reporting in APA style with 'LaTeX' is included.
