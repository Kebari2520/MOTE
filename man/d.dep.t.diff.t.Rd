\title{d from t for Repeated Measures with SD Difference Scores Denominator}
\usage{
d.dep.t.diff.t(t, n, a = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{t-test value}

\item{n}{sample size}

\item{a}{significance level}
}
\value{
\item{d}{effect size}
\item{dlow}{lower level confidence interval d value}
\item{dhigh}{upper level confidence interval d value}
\item{n}{sample size}
\item{df}{degrees of freedom (sample size - 1)}
\item{p}{p-value}
}
\description{
This function displays d for repeated measures data
and the non-central confidence interval using the
standard deviation of the differences as the denominator
estimating from the t-statistic.
}
\details{
To calculate d, the t-statistic is divided by the square root of the sample size.

#The following example is derived from the "dept_data" dataset included
in the MOTE library.

#In a study to test the effects of science fiction movies on peopleâ€™s belief
in the supernatural, seven people completed a measure of belief in
the supernatural before and after watching a popular science
fiction movie. Higher scores indicated higher levels of belief.

    scifi = t.test(dept_data$before, dept_data$after, paired = TRUE)

#The t-test value was 1.4292. You can type in the numbers directly,
or refer to the dataset, as shown below.

    d.dep.t.diff.t(1.429179, n = 7, a = .05)

    d.dep.t.diff.t(1.429179, 7, .05)

    d.dep.t.diff.t(scifi$statistic, length(dept_data$before), .05)

#The mean measure of belief on the pretest (dept_data$before)
was 5.57, with a standard deviation of 1.99. The posttest
(dept_data$after) scores appeared lower (M = 4.43, SD = 2.88) but did not reach
significance, (t(7) = 1.429, p = .20, d = .54), likely due to the small sample size.
The effect size was moderate (d = 0.54) suggesting the movie may
have influenced belief in the supernatural.
