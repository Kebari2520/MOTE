\item{omegahigh}{upper level confidence interval of omega}

\description{
This function displays omega squared from ANOVA analyses
and its non-central confidence interval based on the F distribution.
This formula is appropriate for multi-way repeated measures designs and mix level designs.
}
\details{
Partial omega squared is calculated by subtracting the mean
square for the error from the mean square of the model, which is
multiplied by degrees of freedom of the model. This is divided
by the sum of the sum of squares for the model, sum of squares
for the error, sum of squares for the subject, and the
mean square of the subject.

(dfm * (msm - mse)) / (ssm + sse + sss + mss)

The f-statistic is calculated by dividing the mean square
of the model by the mean square of the error.

F = msm / mse
